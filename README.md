CSharp project

Hi! This project is meant to be a list of warships, the nations that built them, and battles that they participated in.

The program only requires migrations enabled, and an update database call, and you should be good. Thanks, and enjoy


To enable migrations, click "tools", NuGet package manager, Package manager console. Then Type, "Enable-Migrations", then, after that is finished, type, "Update-Database". That shall make sure your database is up to date and ready for the program.
